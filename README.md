# About Keylogger
```
Keyloggers or keystroke loggers are software programs or hardware devices that track the activities (keys pressed) of a keyboard. 
Keyloggers are a form of spyware where users are unaware their actions are being tracked. Keyloggers can be used for a variety of purposes;
hackers may use them to maliciously gain access to your private information, while employers might use them to monitor employee activities.
Some keyloggers can also capture your screen at random intervals; these are known as screen recorders. 
Keylogger software typically stores your keystrokes in a small file, which is either accessed later or automatically emailed to the person monitoring your actions.

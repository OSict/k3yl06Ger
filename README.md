# About Keylogger
```
Keyloggers or keystroke loggers are software programs or hardware devices that track the activities (keys pressed) 
of a keyboard. 
Keyloggers are a form of spyware where users are unawaretheir actions are being tracked.
Keyloggers can be used for a variety of purposes;hackers may use them to maliciously gain access to your private information
while employers might use them to monitor employee
activities.
Some keyloggers can also capture your screen at random intervals;these are known as screen recorders. 
Keylogger software typically stores your keystrokes in a small file,which is either accessed later or automatically emailed 
to the person monitoring your actions.

The  advantage of this technique is that the path of the process being hollowed out will still point to the legitimate path  and the malware can bypass firewalls and  avs , by launching a legitimate process (e.g. Notepad or svchost.exe), users will not be alarmed even if they were to look through the process list...)
